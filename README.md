# Rohit Ranvir

Bachelor of Engineering (May 2025)  
Aspiring Data Scientist & AI Engineer | Java Full Stack Background  
Pusad, Maharashtra, India  

I am a recent engineering graduate with a focused interest in **Data Science, Machine Learning, and Applied AI**.  
My work emphasizes **practical problem-solving, strong fundamentals, and writing clean, maintainable code** rather than surface-level implementations.

I have experience across the **end-to-end development lifecycle**, including data preparation, model development, backend integration, and frontend interaction.
